I found two websites that I used regularly to create the code.
pandas.pydata.org , used frequently to see what commands, attributes, etc. for what I was trying to accomplish.
geeksforgeeks.org, extremely helpful examples of code.

Sometimes I would also do a google search, but I cannot remember a specific search.  This was to find examples of code use, if I could not get mine to work the way I wanted.
